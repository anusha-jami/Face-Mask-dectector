# Face-Mask-dectector
Using Keras, OpenCV, Python
This project Real-time face mask detection using Python is done as a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation - Graduate Rotational Internship Program for the month February 2022. This is a real-time face mask detector, that detects a person is wearing a face mask or not.

# IDE used
Jupyter notebook using TensorFlow backend

# Libraries
1. Keras - for developing and evaluating deep learning models and image processing
2. Sklearn - for machine learning and statistical modeling
3. Numpy - working with arrays
4. cv2 - real time image processing
5. imutils - image processing
